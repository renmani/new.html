						Giorgio Armani also designs products specifically made for babies, toddlers and teenagers up to sixteen years old. Therefore, he came up with a new label called Armani Junior with a separate label within the product line entitled Armani Baby. The Armani Junior brand was introduced in 1979. The sub-label was often criticized in the public eye because Armani occasionally used real fur for the Armani Junior autumn and winter collections. Many people tend to think that it's unreasonable for a large amount of the public to dress small children.

						A|X Armani Exchange was launched in 1991 in the U.S. It retails fashion and lifestyle products and is known for its occasionally provocative ad campaigns. Inspired by street-chic culture and dance music, it is targeted as the more accessible Armani brand.
						To accelerate development of the nascent line, Giorgio Armani co-established the joint venture company Presidio Holdings Ltd in 2005 alongside Como Holdings, the company owned by the Singaporean tycoon Ong Beng Seng that, since 1994, has held the production and distribution license for A/X Armani Exchange in the United States, Canada, Central and South America and Asia-Pacific.
